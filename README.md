# ArduinoLEDGridShowcase
This is code for showcasing the color-displaying capabilities of the RGB 8x8 LED Grid Matrix component built by SparkFun using an Arduino Uno or Duemilanove. My code, written on the basis of example Arduino code from Arduino's website, displays a very simple animation of a Smiley->Frowny Face, as well as a cycle through all 255 colors this grid can display out of the box. I will also upload the circuit I built to connect the component to my Arduino.

This code was written by August Meyer (using example code attributed in code and above as basis) on 3.21.15
